###### The time/frequency can be adjusted based on your feedback. The objective is to share and discuss interesting papers together on a regular basis.

## TLDR;
   - :heavy_plus_sign: :+1: [Add papers](https://github.com/grburgess/awesome-reading-group/issues) and vote on papers you would like to read/discuss
   - :full_moon_with_face: :new_moon_with_face: Everybody is free to attend or not attend; 
   - :memo: Give the paper a read before as much in details, focus on specific parts  
   - :loudspeaker: At the beginning of the sessions a volunteer does a brief introduction of the paper
   - :speech_balloon: Attendance (usually groups 5-8 participants) can discuss, share impressions, ask questions 
   - :hourglass_flowing_sand: Try to keep it 60 minutes.   
   - :pencil2: take 5 mins to write your reflections on the discussion or add extra thoughts. 

## Detailed Intstructions

**1 - ADD and VOTE on papers as comments in the** [voting 
issue](https://github.com/grburgess/awesome-reading-group/issues/)
You may only put the title and the link to the paper, or add any comments to help people to understand why it is worth reading.

**3- Read the selected paper according to one's time/knowledgeâ€‹**
- The next papers to be discussed are added with the discussion date
- You don't have to read everything
- You are not supposed to understand everything
- The purpose of the multi-view discussions is to save time reading all papers in details as different participants will have focused on different parts of the paper.
